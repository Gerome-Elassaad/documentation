## Documentation Style Guide

To maintain consistency across the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Language**:
   - Use simple and concise language.
   - Write in an active voice (e.g., "Click the button" instead of "The button should be clicked").

2. **Markdown**:
   - Use proper Markdown syntax.
   - Organize content with headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
   - Use lists (`-` or `1.`) where appropriate.

3. **Code Blocks**:
   - Use fenced code blocks for any code or terminal commands:
     ```bash
     pnpm install
     ```

4. **Links**:
   - Use relative links for internal references (e.g., `/getting-started`).
   - Use full URLs for external references.

5. **Examples and Screenshots**:
   - Add examples or screenshots whenever possible to make concepts clearer.
